Worksheet Maker
For this project I want to make a program which enables me to take any article of text and create a simple gap-fill worksheet for my students.
I aim to have this program start by removing pronouns and store them in a list below the my sentences.

For this project I expect to go through the following steps.

- [ ] Paste in and store some text eg. Article/story.
- [ ] Make a function for the article.
- [ ] Split the article by sentence.
- [ ] Have each printed/displayed on a new line.
- [ ] Remove and replace each pronoun with a gap. 
- [ ] Print the final list of sentences with gaps and a list of all pronouns (including ones that arenâ€™t in the article) at the bottom.
